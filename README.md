### Hi, I’m Dan

I’m an Associate Research Scientist at the [Flatiron Institute](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/)’s [Center for Computational Astrophysics](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/center-for-computational-astrophysics/) in New York City.
I'm interested in scientific software development, open and reproducible scientific practices, and many other things.
I create too many GitHub repositories and I try to keep up with maintaining them.

Here are some of my coordinates online:
